# this will create a slide with this title

```{r load, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tibble)
library(DT)
```

## level 2 headers will create a new slide
### and level three headers will show up as a section in the slides
### section 2

## Print out gapminder data (this is already a tibble):

```{r gapminder}
gapminder
```

## Convert mtcars to a tibble, and wrap in datatable:

```{r datatable}
datatable(as_tibble(mtcars))
```
