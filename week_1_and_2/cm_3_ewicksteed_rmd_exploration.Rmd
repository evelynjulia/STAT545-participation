<!-- this is how to add a comment in rmarkdown for html -->

<!-- 
tibble::as_tibble()
can use this instead of importing the whole library 
and it also makes the code readable so we know which packages come from which libraries
-->

<!--
label code chunk but {r <name>}
-->
```{r load, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tibble)
library(DT)
```

### Print out gapminder data (this is already a tibble):

```{r gapminder}
gapminder
```

### Convert mtcars to a tibble, and wrap in datatable:
```{r datatable}
datatable(as_tibble(mtcars))
```
